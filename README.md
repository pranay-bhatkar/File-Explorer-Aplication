## ⚙️ Technical Implementation

This project utilizes **Java Swing** for a responsive GUI, organized into a structured folder layout, including:

- **UI Components**: Handles the main interface and context menus.
- **File Operations**: Dedicated classes for various file management tasks.
- **Data Structures**: Efficiently manages file information using `ArrayList` and `DefaultListModel`.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) (version 11 or higher)
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) (optional, for project management)

## 🏗️ How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java-file-explorer.git
   cd java-file-explorer
   ```
2. **Compile the Application**:
    If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, simply import the project and run it. Otherwise,     compile using the command line:
   
   ```bash
   javac -d bin src/*.java
   ```
3. **Run the Application:**
   Execute the following command:
   ```bash
   java -cp bin MainClass
   ```
   Replace ```MainClass``` with the name of your main application ```class``` containing the main method.

## 🔧 Usage
- Launch the application to start navigating your file system.
- Right-click on files or folders to access various operations via the context menu.
- The status bar will always keep you informed of your current path and file details.

## 💡 Challenges Faced
Throughout the development, I encountered several challenges, including:

- **File Path Handling:** Ensuring compatibility across different operating systems.
- **Performance Optimization:** Efficiently loading directories with a high number of files.

## 🌈 Future Enhancements
I'm excited about future enhancements, including:

- Implementing advanced file search functionality.
- Adding file previews for images and documents.
- Enhancing the user interface with modern design trends.
